				<p class="card-text">Located away from Bangalore, Ramanagara is
					a small town in Karnataka. Ramanagara has many short treks that one
					can embark on, including one to the spot where they shot Sholay!
					These treks are perfect for the weekend as climbing up doesn't take
					up much of your time, unless you like to take it slow.</p>

				<p class="card-text">You have two options to get to the top of

					the mountains. The northern side has a proper road and is a little
					more crowded, as it is also used by cyclists and bikers. If you
					want a real trek to the top, take the southern route.</p>
